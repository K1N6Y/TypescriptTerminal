# TypescriptTerminal

TypescriptTerminal is a fun project aimed at testing my React skills. It was inspired by [Chensokheng's terminal-portfolio](https://github.com/Chensokheng/terminal-portfolio).

## Features

- **ls**: List files and directories in the current directory.
- **help**: Display a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- **clear**: Clear the terminal screen.
